<p>My name is Agbo Emmanuel,i recently got an admission into The Curve Africa to study Frontend development as part of the cohort3 for a period of 6 months,
i am happy for this opportunity given to me by The Curve Africa.<br/> we started from editing other code of website, now we are learning how to create our own website. we are starting from HTML.  We were thought some fundamentals on the Html Element and Tags. we were told of the Lorem ipsum which i will be adding to this html webpage.
    <br/>  I am happy to announce that this is my first webpage done by Html,i will very soon be adding CSS and JAVA SCRIPT.

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
